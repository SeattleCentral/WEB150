## Course Description

Examines computer programming theory and basics with the use of the JavaScript programming language. Uses a hands-on approach to building interactive websites with JavaScript and demonstrates how to simplify the web development process with the use of jQuery. Studies several popular web techniques. Prereq: WEB 110 with a grade of 2.0 or higher or permission.

**Prerequisites:** WEB 110 with a grade of 2.0 or higher or permission.
 
## Course Goals

Upon Completion of this course, students will be able to:
			
1. Understand the basics of programming with JavaScript.
2. Learn how to utilize JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery, to simplify the development process.
3. Be comfortable manipulating the DOM with JavaScript and jQuery.
4. Write maintainable, modular code in ES6 syntax.
5. Use the Node.js runtime to develop and deploy JavaScript solutions.


## Textbook (required):

Eloquent JavaScript, 2nd Ed.: A Modern Introduction to Programming

<cite>by Marijn Haverbeke</cite>

Available at the College Bookstore.<br>
**ISBN-10:** 1593275846<br>
**ISBN-13:** 978-1593275846<br>
And also on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-2nd-Ed-Introduction/dp/1593275846/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529953016&sr=8-1&keywords=eloquent+javascript)

## Assignments/Projects

Regular assignments will be posted in Canvas. All assignments are designed to give the student practice with new skills, concepts, and tools covered in class.

Your homework must be turned in on time. Late submissions may be granted partial credit when accompanied by an ingenuitive excuse. Generally speaking, students will learn more if coursework is up-to-date with the lecture. Unfortunately, assignments turned in after course end will receive 0 points. 

To receive full credit, your completed assignment should perform the required functionality and, if specified, use the techniques learned during class. Additionally, all code must meet coding style guidelines. 

Students will have 1 additional week to correct code rejected for not meeting style guidelines. 

Assignments are worth 20 points each.

## Quizzes/Exams

There will be multiple Quizzes, a Midterm, and a Final Exam. Quizzes will normally be administered in class and may be “group efforts.” Missing a Quiz due to absence will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. In most cases, makeups will be allowed unless absences become problematic. The Midterm and Final Exam will include multiple choice questions, short answer, writing short code snippets, and identifying errors in printed code. Quizzes are worth 20 points each. The Midterm and Final Exam are worth 100 points each.

## Materials

USB Drive or Cloud Storage and/or Personal Laptop.

## Attendance 

While regular attendance is not technically mandatory, in practice, it usually is. This is by design to mimic “real life” scenarios. Often times, showing up is the most important thing. And being present for lectures, quizzes, and code reviews will greatly improve your grade.  

This is a programming class and you need to be prepared to work hard and to spend an adequate amount of time outside of the classroom coding.   

## Helping / Working with Others

I encourage you to work with other class members, which is how real life software is produced. However,  you must hand in your own assignments. If found cheating,  you will receive no credit and be subject to college disciplinary action. For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.

## Accessibility

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

# Americans with Disability Act (ADA) (BE1112)

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in BE1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) to be handed to instructor.

## Accommodation Process:

- If a student contacts the instructor about an accommodation request the instructor will refer the student to the Disability Support Service office in BE1112 for an appointment to discuss accommodation needs.

- If the DSS office determines that the student does indeed have a disability the student will be given a letter of accommodation (LOA) that will state the accommodation to be implemented.

- The student’s responsibility is to hand the LOA to the instructor. The instructor will sign the letter (if there is agreement with the accommodation) and give it back to the student. Student will return the LOA to DSS.
